    <h3>Welcome to LangBattle!</h3>
    <p>LangBattle is an arena where you can test your language-learning skills
      against other players, in real-time. <p>
    <p>Currently, two battle modes are available: Time-Trial, and Best of Ten.
      You can change what your native language is (the language questions are displayed in),
      as well as what language you are studying (the language flashcards are displayed in). Check back often, as
      new languages, game modes, and functionality is added regularly!</p>
      <p>To get started, click <a href='/#/arena'>here</a> to go to the arena,
         or click the arena button above. Make sure to have a friend ready to play
         as well!</p>
